# Adosia Token (ADO)

<img src='./images/adosia-icon-200.png' />

This repository contains source, design concepts, usage implementations and future initiatives pertinent to the Adosia Token (ADO).

Development efforts for this repository will entail a Plutus smart contract (to be deployed on the Cardano blockchain protocol)
that will interface with the [Adosia IoT Platform](https://adosia.com) to establish an ecosystem to enable Adosia's IoT Platform users
to monetize/sell/license their perfected IoT device operating profiles by providing their "IP Data" for purchase/use by other Adosia
users within a peer-to-peer marketplace.

A peer-to-peer marketplace for IoT device operating profiles will enable Adosia IoT Platform users to purchase IoT device configurations
in order to to rapidly deploy custom IoT control systems while both rewarding Adosia users for their creativity
and incentivizing them to promote their creations.


# How to Connect IoT Hardware to the Adosia IoT Platform

1. Sign Up FREE for the Adosia IoT Platform [here](https://adosia.com)

2a. Purchase Adosia IoT hardware pre-flashed with the latest Adosia Binary [here](https://adosia.io)

- OR -

2b. Flash [this code](https://github.com/adosia/adosia-token/adosia-token-old/) using the Arduino IDE to your existing ESP8266-based WEMOS D1R2 or WEMOS D1 Mini board to automatically download the latest Adosia binary


All ESP8266 devices that successfully connect to the Adosia IoT platform will be rewarded with a random amount of ADO tokens.
