# Adosia Token (ADO)

This repository contains source, design concepts, usage implementations and future initiatives pertinent to the Adosia Token (ADO).
All Adosia sub-initiatives will have links to corresponding repositories as they become available.

Development efforts relevant to this repository will entail a Plutus smart contract (to be deployed on the Cardano Protocol)
that will interface with the Adosia IoT Platform to establish an ecosystem for Adosia IoT Platform users to monetize (sell/license)
their perfected IoT device operating profiles to other Adosia users within a peer-to-peer marketplace.

This will enable Adosia IoT Platform users to purchase device profils and to rapidly deploy custom IoT control systems
while also rewarding Adosia users for their creativity while incentivizing Adosia users to promote their creations.

The old Adosia ICO token code (Solidity) can be found [here](https://github.com/adosia/adosia-token/adosia-token-old/).
