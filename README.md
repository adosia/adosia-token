# Adosia Token (ADO)

<img src='./images/adosia-icon.png' />

This repository contains source, design concepts, usage implementations and future initiatives pertinent to the Adosia Token (ADO).

Development efforts for this repository will entail a Plutus smart contract (to be deployed on the Cardano blockchain protocol)
that will interface with the Adosia IoT Platform to establish an ecosystem for Adosia's IoT Platform users to monetize (sell/license)
their perfected IoT device operating profiles to other Adosia users within a peer-to-peer marketplace.

This will enable Adosia IoT Platform users to purchase device profils and to rapidly deploy custom IoT control systems
while also rewarding Adosia users for their creativity while incentivizing Adosia users to promote their creations.


# How to Connect IoT Hardware to the Adosia IoT Platform

1. Sign Up FREE for the Adosia IoT Platform [here](https://adosia.com)

2a. Purchase Adosia IoT hardware pre-flashed with the latest Adosia Binary [here](https://adosia.io)

- OR -

2b. Flash [this code](https://github.com/adosia/adosia-token/adosia-token-old/) using the Arduino IDE to your existing ESP8266-based WEMOS D1R2 or WEMOS D1 Mini board to automatically download the latest Adosia binary


All ESP8266 devices that successfully connect to the Adosia IoT platform will be rewarded with a random amount of ADO tokens.
