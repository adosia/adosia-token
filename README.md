# Adosia Token (ADO)

<img src='./images/adosia-icon-200.png' />
This repository contains source, design concepts, usage implementations and future initiatives pertinent to the Adosia Token (ADO).
The goal of the ADO smart contract is to elevate communities by enabling new and powerful peer-to-peer economic opportunities.

The ADO smart contract will enable Adosia IoT Platform users the ability to monetize (sell/license)
their perfected IoT device operating profile creations to other Adosia users within a peer-to-peer marketplace.

Development efforts for this repository will entail a Plutus smart contract (to be deployed on the Cardano blockchain protocol)
that will interface with the [Adosia IoT Platform](https://adosia.com).  

Adosia users can rapidly deploy custom IoT control systems while being incentivized to both create new IoT device profile offerings
and to promote those creations to the world.

# How to Connect IoT Hardware to the Adosia IoT Platform

1. Sign Up FREE for the [Adosia IoT Platform](https://adosia.com)

2. Purchase Adosia IoT hardware pre-flashed with the latest Adosia Binary [here](https://adosia.io)

- OR -

2b. Flash [this code](https://github.com/adosia/adosia-token/adosia-token-old/) using the Arduino IDE to your existing ESP8266-based WEMOS D1R2 or WEMOS D1 Mini board to automatically download the latest Adosia binary


All ESP8266 devices that successfully connect to the Adosia IoT platform will be rewarded with a random amount of ADO tokens.
