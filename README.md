# Adosia Token (ADO) - Initiatives & Concepts [revision 2018-03-02-A]

This repository contains source, design concepts, usage implementations and future initiatives pertinent to the Adosia Token (ADO).  All Adosia sub-initiatives will have links to corresponding repositories as they become available.



Further note that this repository attempts to convey Adosia's current design, plans and thinking,
and will inevitably change during Adosia's implementation of the various ADO integrations.

The ADO Token will have multiple usages:

- Purchase Adosia IoT Hardware

- Purchase IoT Subscriptions

A Bitcoin proof-of-concept is present in the Brave browser,
which has proven invaluable for understanding many of the issues associated with attention-based contribution systems.

# Adosia Roadmap

Consult the roadmap section the Adosia [homepage](https://adosia.com/) for a visual description of the product phases of ADO integration.
